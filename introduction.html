    <meta name="description" content="joel.jacobson@gluefinance.com 2010-10-15 Ecosys from Events to Transactions  Monetary events are represented by monetary transactions between different bookkeeping accounts.  Ecosys is a transaction system, providing the developer with a simple yet powerful interface to register monetary events as they happen in realtime. joel.jacobson@gluefinance.com 2010-10-15 Bookkeeping is a law requirement for all companies, except for some dodgy countries where it is optional. joel.jacobson@gluefinance.com 2010-10-15 Companies CompanyID (PK)	Name 1	Glue Finance AB Ecosys can handle multiple companies within the same database. joel.jacobson@gluefinance.com 2010-10-15 Ecosys support monetary events in all currencies. joel.jacobson@gluefinance.com 2010-10-15 Currencies CurrencyID (PK)	Currency	Description 1	SEK	Swedish Krona 2	EUR	Euro 3	DKK	Danish Krone 4	NOK	Norwegian Krone 5	ZMK	Zambian Kwacha ......	.....	.... ISO 4217 currency codes are used joel.jacobson@gluefinance.com 2010-10-15 Bookkeeping transactions are made between different “bookkeeping accounts”.  A “bookkeeping account” is something entirely different than a “user account”.  For instance, every “bank account” has its own bookkeeping account. joel.jacobson@gluefinance.com 2010-10-15 Accounts AccountID (PK)	AccountNumber	Name	Description	ModificationDate	CompanyID (FK) 1	1941	BANK_ACCOUNT_1	Bank account	2008-06-15 14:40:30	1 2	1942	BANK_ACCOUNT_2	Bank account	2008-06-15 14:40:30	1 3	1943	BANK_ACCOUNT_3	Bank account	2008-06-14 14:40:30	1 4	2420	CLIENT_BALANCES	Debt to clients	2008-06-14 14:40:30	1 5	3001	DEPOSIT_FEES	Financial revenue	2008-06-14 14:40:30	1 6	3002	WITHDRAWAL_FEES	Financial revenue	2008-06-15 14:40:30	1 7	1901	SUSPENSE_ACCOUNT_BANK_ACCOUNT_1	Suspense account	2008-06-15 14:40:30	1 8	1902	SUSPENSE_ACCOUNT_BANK_ACCOUNT_2	Suspense account	2008-06-15 14:40:30	1 9	1903	SUSPENSE_ACCOUNT_BANK_ACCOUNT_3	Suspense account	2008-06-15 14:40:30	1 Name is the unique name of the bookkeeping account.  AccountNumber is unique and is most commonly a four digit number. Glue Finance is using six digit numbers because we have so many bank accounts.  Transactions can only be made between the accounts defined. To simplify for auditors and people working with bookkeeping, the account numbers used for different purposes follows different standards.  In Sweden, EU-BAS2000 is the most recent standard (“kontoplan” in Swedish).  These standards only provide guidance. If the type of account you need doesn’t exists or if you for any other reason want to use a different account number, you are allowed to do so.   joel.jacobson@gluefinance.com 2010-10-15 AccountBalances contain the current balance for each account in each currency.  If there hasn’t been any transactions in a given currency for an account, there is no record of a balance in AccountBalances. A balance record is insert upon the first transaction in a currency using an account, and then updated.  joel.jacobson@gluefinance.com 2010-10-15 AccountBalances AccountBalanceID (PK)	AccountID (FK)	Currency (FK)	Balance	Num	NumDebit	NumCredit	SumDebit	SumCredit 1	1	SEK	1000	1	1	0	1000	0 2	2	SEK	2000	4	3	1	3500	1500 3	3	EUR	500	1	1	0	500	0 4	4	SEK	-2970	9	5	4	1530	4500 5	4	EUR	-490	2	1	1	10	500 6	5	SEK	-10	4	0	4	0	10 7	5	EUR	-10	1	0	1	0	10 8	6	SEK	-20	1	0	1	0	20 9	7	SEK	0	2	1	1	1000	1000 10	8	SEK	0	8	4	4	5000	5000 11	9	EUR	0	2	1	1	500	500 Balance and Currency is the current balance.  Num is the total number of transactions to/from the account in the currency. NumCredit / NumDebit is the total number of transactions to/from the account in the currency. SumCredit / SumDebit is the sum of transactions.  Credit = from = minus(-) = decrease account balance in the currency Debit = to = plus(+) = increase account balance in the currency  joel.jacobson@gluefinance.com 2010-10-15 Annoying facts debit/credit vs +/- Bean counter language	Actual meaning	Debit / Credit	+ / - “Assets are increased with debits and decreased with credits”	When you put money into a bank account, it is a debit	Debit	+ credit |ˈkredit| verb ( credited , crediting ) [ trans. ] (often be credited)  2 add (an amount of money) to an account : this deferred tax can be credited to the profit and loss account. 	Add = +, right? No, “add” of course means “-” 	Credit	- joel.jacobson@gluefinance.com 2010-10-15 Monetary events are of different types.  Most likely, you will have a limited number of different types of monetary events.  Some of the event types will occur very frequently, like hundreds per second, while others will be very uncommon, like the receiption of an invoice from a supplier. joel.jacobson@gluefinance.com 2010-10-15 EventTypes EventTypeID (PK)	Datestamp 1	2008-06-15 14:40:30 2	2008-06-15 14:40:30 A new EventType is automatically created when a new event with a different mix of “flag keys” are seen for the first time.  Two events might have different “flag values”, but as long as they have the same number of flags with the same names, the EventType is the same.  The “flag keys” determine the EventType, independent of the flag values.  More on flags later on... joel.jacobson@gluefinance.com 2010-10-15 New monetary events are inserted into the Events table.  Events have an amount, currency, different kind of timestamps and a plain hash, where the key/values contain the information needed to what monetary transactions to perform.  The keys of the hash are called Flags. The unique set of Flags determine the EventType.  More on Flags, FlagValues, EventTypes later on... joel.jacobson@gluefinance.com 2010-10-15 Events EventID (PK)	EventTypeID (FK)	Transaction Date	Value Date	Amount	Currency	Processed	Datestamp	ChainID	Undone	BindID 1	1	2010-10-14	2010-10-14	2000	SEK	1	2010-10-13 15:09:02	1	0	1 2	2	2010-10-14	2010-10-14	2000	SEK	1	2010-10-13 15:09:02	1	0	3 3	1	2010-10-14	2010-10-14	1500	SEK	1	2010-10-13 15:22:14	3	0	2 4	2	2010-10-14	2010-10-14	1500	SEK	1	2010-10-13 15:22:14	3	0	4 TransactionDate and ValueDate are identical to Datestamp for most automatic monetary events.  The data type is timestamp with time zone, but it wouldn’t fit in the boxes so it is truncated to date in the example seen.  Processed can be 0 or 1. When using Ecosys inside your database application, you will always process the event in the same transaction block as the event is registered. Therefore, there will be no events with Processed set to 0, since everything is always processed before committing.  In an application when using Ecosys in batch mode, where events needs to be registered first and processed at a later time, Processed will be 0 until they are processed. Glue Finance is not using this mode.  If a created event is related to a previous registered event, they can be chained. The EventID with the lowest value (the oldest event) will be used as ChainID.  Chaining events makes it easy to trace events are see what has happened before and after the event you are interested in.  Chaining also affects the processing of events and read queries to Ecosys. More on that later... joel.jacobson@gluefinance.com 2010-10-15 Flags can be though of as keys in a hash.  Flags have unique names and a unique ID. joel.jacobson@gluefinance.com 2010-10-15 Flags FlagID (PK)	Name	Datestamp 1	order_type	2010-10-14 15:37:02 2	clearing_house	2010-10-14 15:37:02 3	bank_number	2010-10-14 15:37:02 4	account_number	2010-10-14 15:37:02 5	username	2010-10-14 15:37:02 These flags would be sufficient to represent deposits/withdrawals to/from bank accounts. joel.jacobson@gluefinance.com 2010-10-15 A FlagValues is a unique combination of a Flag and a value. joel.jacobson@gluefinance.com 2010-10-15 FlagValues FlagValueID (PK)	FlagID (FK)	Value	Datestamp 1	1	BANK_DEPOSIT	2010-10-14 15:37:02 2	1	BANK_WITHDRAWAL	2010-10-14 15:37:02 3	2	SWEDEN	2010-10-14 15:37:02 4	2	FINLAND	2010-10-14 15:37:02 5	3	83279	2010-10-14 15:37:02 6	3	578954	2010-10-14 15:37:02 7	4	9048832662	2010-10-14 15:37:02 8	4	20038221	2010-10-14 15:37:02 9	5	betsafe	2010-10-14 15:37:02 10	5	betsson	2010-10-14 15:37:02 Each Value for each flag is unique.  For flags, such as “order_id”, where the value is new for each Event, a new FlagValue entry is created for every order. For other flags, where the same value is being used for many events, the FlagValue is reused for such events. joel.jacobson@gluefinance.com 2010-10-15 EventFlags contain the FlagValues of the Event when it was registered.  Once an event has been created, none of its columns can be modified and none of the flag values will be modified, added or deleted.  joel.jacobson@gluefinance.com 2010-10-15 EventFlags EventID (PK)	FlagValueID (PK)	Processed	Datestamp 1	1	1	2010-10-13 15:09:02 2	2	1	2010-10-13 15:09:02 3	1	1	2010-10-13 15:22:14 4	2	1	2010-10-13 15:22:14 Multi-column primary key consisting of EventID and FlagValueID.  Processed has to do with something we will go through later on. Let’s skip that for now. joel.jacobson@gluefinance.com 2010-10-15 EventTypeFlags define the Flags for a given EventType.  The set of Flags are unique for each EventType, i.e., no two EventTypes can share the same mix of Flags. joel.jacobson@gluefinance.com 2010-10-15 EventTypeFlags EventTypeID (PK)	FlagID (PK)	Datestamp 1	1	2010-10-13 15:09:02 1	2	2010-10-13 15:09:02 1	3	2010-10-13 15:09:02 1	4	2010-10-13 15:09:02 2	1	2010-10-13 15:09:02 2	2	2010-10-13 15:09:02 2	3	2010-10-13 15:09:02 2	4	2010-10-13 15:09:02 2	5	2010-10-13 15:09:02 EventTypeID and FlagID is the two-column primary key.  Once an event type has been created, it is never modified or deleted and the flags are never changed. joel.jacobson@gluefinance.com 2010-10-15 A Rule is a unique combination of two accounts, a FromAccount and a ToAccount, between which money are transferred.  If there is no rule allowing transactions between two accounts, no transactions can ever have been made between the accounts.  The list of rules give you a rough picture of what kind of monetary activities goes on in the company. joel.jacobson@gluefinance.com 2010-10-15 Rules RuleID (PK)	FromAccountID	ToAccountID	Datestamp	UseRuleModel 1	7	1	2010-10-13 15:09:02	FALSE 2	1	7	2010-10-13 15:09:02	FALSE 3	8	2	2010-10-13 15:09:02	FALSE 4	2	8	2010-10-13 15:09:02	FALSE 5	9	3	2010-10-13 15:09:02	FALSE 6	3	9	2010-10-13 15:09:02	FALSE 7	4	7	2010-10-13 15:09:02	FALSE 8	4	8	2010-10-13 15:09:02	FALSE 9	4	9	2010-10-13 15:09:02	FALSE 10	7	4	2010-10-13 15:09:02	FALSE 11	8	4	2010-10-13 15:09:02	FALSE 12	9	4	2010-10-13 15:09:02	FALSE 13	5	4	2010-10-13 15:09:02	TRUE 14	6	4	2010-10-13 15:09:02	TRUE FromAccountID and ToAccountID is unique. If UseRuleModel is FALSE, the Amount and Currency of the Event is transferred between the accounts. If it is set to TRUE, the Amount and Currency is calculated using a RuleModel. More on that soon...  joel.jacobson@gluefinance.com 2010-10-15 RuleFunctions defines different algorithms to compute a different Amount and Currency to transfer between accounts than the Event’s Amount/Currency.  The functions usually operate on the Event’s Amount/Currency or any of it flags, but they could theoretically base the calculation on something else.  Glue Finance use RuleFunctions to calculate transaction fees, calculate employment tax on salaries, calculate the VAT part of receipts. joel.jacobson@gluefinance.com 2010-10-15 RuleFunctions RuleFunctionID (PK)	Name	RuleFunctionParamsTemplate 1	Fixed	&lt;Fixed Amount=&quot;10.00&quot; Currency=&quot;SEK&quot; /&gt; 2	Percentage	&lt;Percentage Percentage=&quot;3&quot; Currency=”EUR” Min=”1” Max=”10” /&gt; 3	Exchange	&lt;Exchange&gt;&lt;Fixed Amount=&quot;10.00&quot; Currency=&quot;SEK&quot; /&gt;&lt;/Exchange&gt; 4	FlagValue	&lt;FlagValue AmountFlag=&quot;vat_amount&quot; CurrencyFlag=&quot;vat_currency&quot; /&gt; These are the four rule functions currently being used by Glue Finance.  RuleFunctionParamsTemplate is just an example of what the XML definition of the parameters passed to the function might look like.  joel.jacobson@gluefinance.com 2010-10-15 Rule functions can be written in any SP language.  They must return RECORD.  The OUT params must be _Amount numeric, _Currency char(3). The IN params must be _EventID integer, _ParamXML xml.  joel.jacobson@gluefinance.com 2010-10-15 For a given set of FlagValues present in the Event, for a given Rule, RuleModels define the RuleModel to be used, which is a RuleFunction and XML parameters to the rule function. joel.jacobson@gluefinance.com 2010-10-15 RuleModels RuleModelID (PK)	RuleID (FK)	FlagValueIDs[]	StartDate	RuleFunctionID (FK)	RuleFunctionParams	Datestamp 1	13	[1,3,9]	2010-10-13	1	&lt;Fixed Amount=&quot;2.50&quot; Currency=&quot;SEK&quot; /&gt;	2010-10-12 09:15:02 2	13	[1,4,9]	2010-10-13	1	&lt;Fixed Amount=&quot;10.00&quot; Currency=&quot;EUR&quot; /&gt;	2010-10-12 09:15:02 3	14	[2,3,9]	2010-10-13	2	&lt;Percentage Percentage=&quot;3&quot; /&gt;	2010-10-12 09:15:02 4	14	[2,4,9]	2010-10-13	2	&lt;Percentage Percentage=&quot;2&quot; /&gt;	2010-10-12 09:15:02 5	13	[1,3,10]	2010-10-13	1	&lt;Fixed Amount=&quot;3.00&quot; Currency=&quot;SEK&quot; /&gt;	2010-10-12 09:15:02 6	13	[1,4,10]	2010-10-13	1	&lt;Fixed Amount=&quot;12.00&quot; Currency=&quot;EUR&quot; /&gt;	2010-10-12 09:15:02 7	14	[2,3,10]	2010-10-13	2	&lt;Percentage Percentage=&quot;1.5&quot; /&gt;	2010-10-12 09:15:02 8	14	[2,4,10]	2010-10-13	2	&lt;Percentage Percentage=&quot;4&quot; /&gt;	2010-10-12 09:15:02 For a RuleModel to be applied for a given RuleID, the FlagValueIDs defined must be present in the Event.  RuleFunctionParams are passed to the rule function.  StartDate defines the startdate from when the RuleModel is being used. joel.jacobson@gluefinance.com 2010-10-15 Bindings is the mapping of Flags and Rules.  Bindings is a central component in Ecosys, defining how to process events and what transactions to perform. joel.jacobson@gluefinance.com 2010-10-15 Bindings BindID (PK)	EventTypeID (FK)	Name	Datestamp 1	1	Bank deposit to BANK_ACCOUNT_1	2010-10-12 09:15:02 2	1	Bank deposit to BANK_ACCOUNT_2	2010-10-12 09:15:02 3	1	Bank deposit to BANK_ACCOUNT_3	2010-10-12 09:15:02 4	1	Bank withdrawal from BANK_ACCOUNT_1	2010-10-12 09:15:02 5	1	Bank withdrawal from BANK_ACCOUNT_2	2010-10-12 09:15:02 6	1	Bank withdrawal from BANK_ACCOUNT_3	2010-10-12 09:15:02 7	2	Client deposit to BANK_ACCOUNT_1	2010-10-12 09:15:02 8	2	Client deposit to BANK_ACCOUNT_2	2010-10-12 09:15:02 9	2	Client deposit to BANK_ACCOUNT_3	2010-10-12 09:15:02 10	2	Client withdrawal from BANK_ACCOUNT_1	2010-10-12 09:15:02 11	2	Client withdrawal from BANK_ACCOUNT_2	2010-10-12 09:15:02 12	2	Client withdrawal from BANK_ACCOUNT_3	2010-10-12 09:15:02 Bindings have unique names and are of a given EventType. joel.jacobson@gluefinance.com 2010-10-15 BindFlags define what flags must be present for the Binding to match an Event.  The Binding matching the most number of flag values will be selected.  Only Bindings with the same mix of flags names are candidates. joel.jacobson@gluefinance.com 2010-10-15 BindFlags BindID (PK)	FlagID (PK)	FlagValueID	ModificationDate 1	1	1	2010-10-12 09:15:02 1	2	3	2010-10-12 09:15:02 1	3	5	2010-10-12 09:15:02 1	4	7	2010-10-12 09:15:02 2	1	1	2010-10-12 09:15:02 2	2	3	2010-10-12 09:15:02 2	3	5	2010-10-12 09:15:02 2	4	7	2010-10-12 09:15:02 2	5	9	2010-10-12 09:15:02 FlagValueID can be NULL, meaning any flag value will do, but the flag must be present.  For a given BindID, only the flags in BindFlags must be present, no fewer, no more. The flags determine the EventTypeID, present in the Bindings table as seen before. joel.jacobson@gluefinance.com 2010-10-15 BindRules defines the rules to be performed when a Binding matches an Event. joel.jacobson@gluefinance.com 2010-10-15 BindRules BindID (PK)	RuleID (PK)	ModificationDate 1	1	2010-10-12 09:15:02 2	7	2010-10-12 09:15:02 2	13	2010-10-12 09:15:02 A Bidning must have at least one Rule.  There is no upper limit on the numer of Rules a Binding can have. joel.jacobson@gluefinance.com 2010-10-15 ...and finally, Transactions, the table containing the actual monetary transactions.  Transactions occur between Accounts, due to the Rules defined in Rules and optionally RuleModels, in different Currencies, as a result of the Events created.  Transactions affects AccountBalances, increasing or decreasing the balance of the account in the given currency. joel.jacobson@gluefinance.com 2010-10-15 Transactions Transaction ID (PK)	Event ID (FK)	Rule ID (FK)	Account ID (FK)	Amount	Balance	Sum Credit	Sum Debit	Num	Num Credit	Num Debit	Currency	Account Balances Daily ID	Rule Model ID	RecordDate 1	1	1	7	-1000.00	-1000.00	1000.00	0.00	1	1	0	SEK	1		2010-10-15 10:00:01 2	1	1	1	1000.00	1000.00	0.00	1000.00	1	0	1	SEK	2		2010-10-15 10:00:01 3	2	7	7	1000.00	0.00	1000.00	1000.00	2	1	1	SEK	1		2010-10-15 10:00:01 4	2	7	4	-1000.00	-1000.00	1000.00	0.00	1	1	0	SEK	3		2010-10-15 10:00:01 5	2	13	5	-2.50	-2.50	2.50	0.00	1	1	0	SEK	4	1	2010-10-15 10:00:01 6	2	13	4	2.50	2.50	0.00	2.50	1	0	1	SEK	3	1	2010-10-15 10:00:01 Each Transaction has a unique TransactionID. EventID shows the monetary event which resulted in the Transaction. RuleID shows which rule resulted in the Transaction. Amount/Currency is the transferred amount to/from the Account. If the Amount is less than zero, it is a debit transaction, money is transferred from the account, the account’s balance is decreased. If the Amount is greater than zero, it is a credit transactions, money is transferred to the account, the account’s balance is increased.  SumDebit, SumCredit, Num, NumDebit, NumCredit shows the sum of and number of all debit/credits transactions, at the point in time when the transaction was executed. This statistics are very useful to quickly compute deltas between two points in time. joel.jacobson@gluefinance.com 2010-10-15 When the Event has been processed, it is assigned the BindID for the Binding which matched the event’s flag.  joel.jacobson@gluefinance.com 2010-10-15 The indata to the New_Event function can be an XML document, alternatively the arguments can be passed as function parameters, where the flags are translated into a two dimensional array.  The later variant is obviously faster, since it won’t require parsing of the XML document.  joel.jacobson@gluefinance.com 2010-10-15 New_Event() almost always only writes data to Events, EventFlags and FlagValues. Flags, EventTypeFlags and EventTypes are also used, but only for read queries, except when new event types are invented.  New_Event() joel.jacobson@gluefinance.com 2010-10-15 Process_Events() When the event is processed, transactions are written to Transactions and the balances for each account in each currency is updated in AccountBalances.  Events is also updated, setting Processed to 1.   joel.jacobson@gluefinance.com 2010-10-15 To add accounts and/or bindings, an XML document is written, containing the new accounts (if any) and the definition of the bindings.  Bindings must define a set of Rules and define the flags which must match.  The Value=”” part is optional, if it is not present, any value of the flag will match.  Each binding must define a &lt;Test&gt; unit, which safeguards against typos. If the events in the Test won’t result in the expected balance changes, Ecosys will refuse to import the entire XML document. joel.jacobson@gluefinance.com 2010-10-15 Example of a binding where the flag “username” has no Value attribute. Any value of the flag “username” will match. In the test, the username is set to “test”.  The rule between DEPOSIT_FEES and CLIENT_BALANCES has UseRuleModel set to TRUE, meaning a single RuleModel must match, otherwise the event is invalid and can’t be processed.  In this example, the RuleModel selected depends on the order_type, clearing_house and username."/>
